## Credits
This app was built from the ground up in XCode in Swift for macOS. However, the project was inspired by and is essentially a clone of Jack Carver's "Animal Crossing Music" Google Chrome extension, the website for which is [here for the GitHub](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension#) and [here for the Extension download link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/animal-crossing-music/fcedlaimpcfgpnfdgjbmmfibkklpioop?hl=en).

I just wanted to make a version of this app for macOS users that doesn't require Chrome since it is such a resource-hog on macOS! Consider this a solution for non-Chrome users that'll be more friendly on your battery life! Nevertheless, all credit for this idea goes to J. Carver (and whoever he got the idea from; see his documentation).

## Change Log
### V. 2.5:
* Added New Leaf rainy music!
* Fixed a bug where K.K. will automatically start playing on Saturday nights

## Features
* Unintrusive! It lives in your menu bar and plays Animal Crossing Music on the hour.
* Choose music from Animal Crossing/Animal Forest (GCN/N64), Wild World/City Folk, or New Leaf! 
* Optionally plays your choice of live or airplay K.K. Slider Music on Saturday nights between 8PM and 11:59. A menu is enabled while K.K. is playing showing the name of the song, where you can ask K.K. to play a different song!
* Optionally shows a notification every hour indicating a time change
* Plays a custom town tune every hour! Write your own town tune in the town tune editor menu. A handful of presets are made available. Random note recently added. 

## How to install
Just drag the .app file to your "Applications" folder on your Mac! You may get asked if you want to trust me on first start up, but after that it should run! The app is very gentle on resources, so feel free to always have it up in the menu bar without fear of battery decay.

It hasn't been tested by really anyone and is likely to be pretty buggy. If you're having any issues, make sure to set all your preferences when you start it up for the first time! Set and **save** your preferred town tune, and enable/disable any features you want.
